## Contributor License Agreements

I'd love to accept your pull request! Before I can take them, we have to jump a
couple of legal hurdles.

signed the CLA can be accepted into the main repository.

Please fill out either the individual or corporate Contributor License Agreement (CLA).
* If you are an individual writing original source code and you're sure you own the
  intellectual property, then you'll need to sign an [individual CLA](/assets/cla/individual_cla.md).
* If you work for a company that wants to allow you to contribute your work, then
  you'll need to sign a [corporate CLA](/assets/cla/corporate_cla.md).

Follow either of the two links above to access the appropriate CLA. Next, if you are
ready to accept, add the following text in the body your first commit message.

## Development Environment

The contribution to `portal` and `authorize` plugins requires setting up a development
environment. The following steps allow developers to test Caddy server with
the plugins using local source code.

First, designate directory for building caddy with plugins, e.g. `tmpcaddydev`.

```bash
mkdir -p ~/tmpcaddydev
cd ~/tmpcaddydev
```

Second, fork the following repositories in Github into to your own Github
handle, e.g. `anonymous`:

* `https://github.com/greenpau/caddy-auth-portal` => `https://github.com/anonymous/caddy-auth-portal`
* `https://github.com/greenpau/caddy-authorize` => `https://github.com/anonymous/caddy-authorize`
* `https://github.com/greenpau/caddy-trace` => `https://github.com/anonymous/caddy-trace`
* `https://github.com/greenpau/go-identity` => `https://github.com/anonymous/go-identity`

Provided you are in `tmpcaddydev` directory, clone the forked repositories:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:anonymous/caddy-auth-portal.git
git clone git@github.com:anonymous/caddy-authorize.git
git clone git@github.com:anonymous/caddy-trace.git
git clone git@github.com:anonymous/go-identity.git
```

Next, browse to `caddy-auth-portal` and run the following `make` command to install
various dependencies:

```bash
cd caddy-auth-portal
make dep
```

Next, modify `go.mod` in `github.com/greenpau/caddy-auth-portal`. Include
`replace` directives to instruct `go` using local directories, as opposed
to follow Github versions.

```
module github.com/greenpau/caddy-auth-portal

# intentionally omitted

replace github.com/greenpau/caddy-authorize v1.2.7 => /home/greenpau/dev/go/src/github.com/greenpau/caddy-authorize

replace github.com/greenpau/caddy-trace v1.1.6 => /home/greenpau/dev/go/src/github.com/greenpau/caddy-trace

replace github.com/greenpau/go-identity v1.0.23 => /home/greenpau/dev/go/src/github.com/greenpau/go-identity
```

Once all the necessary packages are installed, you should be ready to compile
`caddy` using the local source code. Run:

```bash
make
```

The above make command creates `xcaddy-caddy-auth-portal` directory in `tmpcaddydev`.
Then, it starts building `caddy` and referencing locally sources plugins.

After the build, the resultant binary will be in `bin/` directory. You can
then test it with your own configuration files.

```bash
bin/caddy run -config /etc/gatekeeper/Caddyfile | jq
```
